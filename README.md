# 🌱 Hey, I'm Elijah. 

💻 I'm a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate studying at the University of the Philippines – Diliman. 

Lately, I've been dabbling in Data Science 📊 and Web Development, and I aim to leverage these interests into **meaningful projects** that tackle 🗺️ *real-world*  problems.


## 🔭 Showcase
> Here are some projects I've worked on! 
- 📈 This [data science project](https://tes-birth-rate.vercel.app) on the relationship between *poverty* and *parenting*.
- 🌐 A [reddit client](https://github.com/UPD-CS-12/cs12222project-maca-mejilla) built using Flutter-based Python libraries.
- 🧸 A [self-care web application](https://github.com/compsat/bh24-based-template) made for a Hackathon.
